    <ol>
        <li>Cook pasta according to package directions; Drain and rinse in cold water. Transfer to a large bowl; set aside.</li>
        <li>While the pasta is boiling, season chicken with the herbs, garlic powder, salt and pepper. Heat 1 teaspoon of oil on in a grill pan or skillet, and sear chicken breasts over medium-high heat until browned on both sides and cooked through (about 6 minutes each side). Remove from pan; set aside and allow to rest.</li>

        <li>Mix in the vinegar, parmesan cheese and basil (or parsley). Season with salt and pepper to your taste. Slice the chicken; add to pasta. Toss the pasta with all of the ingredients until well combined.</li>
